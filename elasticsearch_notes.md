# ElasticSearch
## What is elasticsearch ?
Elasticsearch is a search engine build on top of Lucene (Open Source by Apache S.F.). Elasticsearch uses NoSql database for storing data and provides distributed, real time, JSON based multi tenant capable full text search solutions. Let's look at solutions of ElasticSearch individually:

- **Lucene** - is a java based search library. There are functions and methods written in Java which are optinised for different search strategies. The differences between Lucene and Elasticsearch is that Lucene is a library and the implementation of Lucene is very hard but Elasticsearch backboned Lucene and provides more features(RestFul API) and uses flexible data structures.
- **Distributed System** - 

Use cases:

- Search
- Log Collection/Parsing and Analytics
- Content connectors (colect data from different sources)
- Instant visualisation (with Kibana UI)
-
